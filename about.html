		<h2> About Me </h2>
		
		<p2>I recently finished my PhD in computational theoretical astrohpysics at the Institute of Astronomy, University of Cambridge. In March I will be starting work as a post-doctoral research associate at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Garching, Munich. </p2>

		<p2> In addition to a lifelong passion for astronomy I am a keen follower of underground music and enjoy staff spinning and other flow arts. </p2>

		<p2> I am currently exploring the capacity of music festivals as a place to conduct science outreach </p2>
