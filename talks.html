		<h2> Talks </h2>
		<p>Science communication is a passion of mine and I delight in sharing my knowledge of the workings of the universe with anyone and everyone. I have countless given talks at specialist global conferences, university departments, to school children, to members of the government, at music festivals and at a variety of structured outreach events. <p>
			<p>Since 2018 I have been exploring the potential of music festivals as a location to conduct scientific outreach. Conventional scientific outreach can sometimes attract those with an existing passion for the subject rather than acting to inspire those that believe science has little to no relevance to their lives. I initially started with small, local events and have progressed to giving lectures and workshops at internationally recognised festivals with multinational line-ups and thousands of attendees from around the globe.
