		<h2> Research Interests </h2>
		<p2> My research interests centre on binary star interactions, in particular tidal dissipation and deformation of stars. Thus far I have developed a computational routine for tidal interactions in both convective and radiative zones. I have incorporated into the Cambridge STARS code. </p2>
		<p2>Whilst my work so far has been predominantly based on hot subdwarf B (sdB) systems I am interested in overall binary stellar evolution. I am currently applying calculations to a variety of regions in the H-R diagram to study where tides are most effective and where they are negligible.
